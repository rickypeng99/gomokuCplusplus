## 2018 - Apr 18 code review 1
Right now I have completed constructing the game board and each player is now allowed to make a move on it. <br>

I will be adding a AI player to play with me next week.

My program also needs a validation method to check is whoever is winning.

## 2018 - Apr 20
I have finished validation

## 2018 - Apr 23rd
I have built a simple AI, it is woking pretty well

## 2018 - Apr 29th
The player is now able to pick which mode to play (Versus AI or 1v1 mode)

## Future goal
Build a better AI with minimax tree and alpha-beta pruning.
