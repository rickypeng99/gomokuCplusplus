# Project Proposal

In my project, I hope to make a program that automatically finds a best-fit line that defines the linear relationship of 2 variables.<br>
For instance, you can have the prices as Y axis, and amount of people willing to buy as the x axis. By inputing the data as each corresposing level, the program can find a best fit line that represents the price elasticity of this product.<br>
