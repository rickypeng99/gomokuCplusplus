# Project Proposal - Gomoku
## Intro
In my project, I hope to make a program that simulates the Gomoku game. Which is the Chinese version of connect 5.
## AI
There will be an AI that plays with me. I am tring to implement the minimax tree and alpha-beta pruning techniques. <br>
However, a simpler AI is also ok for my project since I believe that the above algorithms are above my current level, I will make sure have a try tho!

## Visual example:

## Library using:
math library <br>
I need to write equations with it.<br>
ofSoundPlayer <br>
I use this to play the sound when a player moves.
